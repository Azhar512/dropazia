# 🔧 Fix User Registration Error

## Problem
"Failed to register user" error when trying to register new users.

## ✅ What I Fixed

1. **Database Connection**
   - Added `await connectDB()` in registration controller
   - Ensures database is connected before saving

2. **Role Mapping**
   - Frontend sends "reseller" but backend expects "seller"
   - Added automatic mapping: `reseller` → `seller`

3. **Better Error Handling**
   - More specific error messages
   - Detailed logging for debugging
   - Handles validation errors, duplicate emails, etc.

4. **Field Validation**
   - Phone and module are now optional (won't fail if empty)
   - Better handling of empty/undefined values

5. **Frontend Error Display**
   - Shows specific error messages from backend
   - Better console logging for debugging

## 🚀 Deploy Fix

The changes are ready. You need to:

1. **Push to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git add -A
   git commit -m "fix: Improve user registration with better error handling and database connection"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for Vercel to deploy

3. **Test Registration:**
   - Try registering with form data
   - Check browser console for detailed logs
   - Should see specific error if it fails

## 🔍 Debugging

If registration still fails, check:

1. **Browser Console (F12):**
   - Look for `🔄 Registering user:` log
   - Check `📥 Registration response:` for error details
   - Look for `❌ Registration error:` messages

2. **Vercel Logs:**
   - Go to Vercel Dashboard → Your Project → Logs
   - Look for registration attempts
   - Check for database connection errors

3. **Common Issues:**
   - Email already exists → Try different email
   - Password too weak → Use 8+ chars with letter and number
   - Database connection → Check MONGODB_URI in Vercel
   - Network error → Check API URL is correct

## ✅ Expected Behavior After Fix

1. User fills registration form
2. Clicks "Create Account"
3. Sees success message with admin approval notice
4. User appears in admin dashboard "Pending Approvals" tab

**After deploying, registration should work perfectly!**
