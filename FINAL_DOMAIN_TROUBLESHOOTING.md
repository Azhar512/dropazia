### **Step 1: Clear All Caches**

**Hostinger Cache:**
1. In Hostinger dashboard → Click "Clear cache" button
2. Wait 2 minutes

**Browser Cache:**
1. Chrome: `Ctrl + Shift + Delete` → Clear all cached images/files
2. Or use Incognito mode

**DNS Cache (Windows):**
```cmd
ipconfig /flushdns
```
Run in Command Prompt as Administrator

### **Step 2: Test from Different Location**

1. **Use your phone** (on mobile data, not WiFi)
2. **Visit**: `https://dropazia.online`
3. **If it works**: It's a local cache issue
4. **If it doesn't work**: Continue to Step 3

### **Step 3: Verify Temporary Domain Works**

1. **Visit**: `https://lightgrey-snake-316283.hostingersite.com`
2. **If this works**: Your files are correct, issue is with dropazia.online specifically
3. **If this doesn't work**: Files might not be uploaded correctly

### **Step 4: Contact Hostinger Support**

**If still not working:**

1. **Click**: "Ask Kodee" (purple chat button)
2. **Say exactly**:
   ```
   Domain: dropazia.online

   ```

### **Step 5: Check Domain Settings**

1. **Go to**: "Domains" in left sidebar
2. **Click**: `dropazia.online`
3. **Check**:
