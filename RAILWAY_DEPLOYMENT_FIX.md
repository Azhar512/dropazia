## üöÄ Alternative: Deploy to Vercel Instead

Since you already have Vercel working, let's deploy the backend there:

### Create Backend Service on Vercel:

1. Go to Vercel dashboard: https://vercel.com
2. Click **"Add New..."** ‚Üí **"Project"**
3. Select `dropazia` repository again
4. **Important:** Click **"Edit"** next to "Root Directory"
5. Set root directory to: `backend`
6. Click **"Deploy"**

### Add Environment Variables in Vercel:
1. Go to your project settings
2. Click **"Environment Variables"**
3. Add these variables:

```
NODE_ENV = production
MONGODB_URI = mongodb+srv://dropazia:dropazia123@cluster0.9hv504i.mongodb.net/?appName=Cluster0
PORT = 5000
JWT_SECRET = dGhpcyBpcyBhIHNlY3VyZSByYW5kb20gamV5dCBrZXkgZm9yIHByb2R1Y3Rpb24gZGVwbG95bWVudA
FRONTEND_URL = https://dropazia.shop
```

4. Click **"Redeploy"**
